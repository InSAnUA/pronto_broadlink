This script converts pronto codes that you get from http://irdb.tk/ or
https://irdb.globalcache.com/Home/Database and prints them in the format
that can be used with Broadlink universal remote (tested with RM 3 mini).

# Usage

First replace the sample codes in `pronto.txt` and run:

```bash
python2 pronto2broadlink.py
```
